IS-SPA is an implicit solvent model that was developed in the McCullagh Group. We have written several versions of IS-SPA in CUDA in attempts to highly optimize the code. A copy of my thesis chapter which discusses the difference between the 3 IS-SPA algorithms has been included in this directory.

Algorithm 2 has been shown to be the most efficient for a majority of system sizes.

The code can be compliled by moving into the src/ directory and running:
make

There are several directories included with different system sizes of Alanine Dipeptide (ADI) molecules. These various directories were used to create the data show in the chapter.

ADI2 - 2 molecules
ADI10 - 10 molecules
ADI25 - 25 molecues
ADI50 - 50 molecules

ADI2_US - contains files to run Umbrella sampling of 2 molecules using the CUDA code

mcADI2 and mcADI50 are directories in which I calculate the efficiency of the code for a varying number of monte carlo points per atom (nMC)

plots/ contains the files I used to plot the figures shown in the chapter.
